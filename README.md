# cv-project
A cv application app built in reactJS as part of the Odin project.

The Objective is to build it first with Class components and then later on rework it to be used
with function components.

The stages of the project will be as follows and I will be using these as reference points for my commits:

First stage: 
Build the Skeleton of a cv with title headers such as: Personal Information, About me, Employment history, Education history and contact details.

Second stage:
The main stage,
Add the ability to click a button next to each header to add the information, save it and display it.

Third stage:
Add the functionality to be able to edit or delete certain information e.g education or employment.

Fourth Stage:
To be decided.
